# Testing ⚠️

Manual testing strategy.

## Not Implemented

- [ ] No test framework configured (vitest not installed)
- [ ] No unit tests
- [ ] No integration tests
- [ ] No e2e tests

Note: The plan specifies a "manual testing strategy." No automated test infrastructure exists. Consider adding vitest for unit/integration tests if automated testing is desired.
